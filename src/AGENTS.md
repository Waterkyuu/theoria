## Coding Rules


### UI / UX Design
@DESIGN.md

### Avoid Redundant Type Guards

1. Do not write large numbers of unnecessary type guards that make maintenance difficult. Handle responses strictly according to their declared types.

```tsx
// Bad
type UnknownRecord = Record<string, unknown>;

const isRecord = (value: unknown): value is UnknownRecord => {
  return typeof value === 'object' && value !== null && !Array.isArray(value);
};

Array.isArray()

typeof xxx === 'string' || typeof xxx === 'function'
```

### Do Not Implement Error Handling Separately

1. Shared error handling must be encapsulated in `src/utils/error.ts` and called consistently.

### TypeScript

1. Do not use `any` to bypass type checking. If absolutely necessary, use `unknown` and add a comment marking the risk.
2. Types used only by the current file should be declared at module scope, after imports and before the implementation. Types reused across files should be placed in the relevant `src/types` module.
3. Every field in a type declaration must have a comment explaining its purpose.
4. Use utility types such as `Partial`, `Pick`, and `Omit` appropriately to reduce duplicated type definitions.

### Exports

1. Do not add `export` before every function. Use a consolidated `export` statement at the end instead, such as `export { xxx, xxx }`.

The following examples show the incorrect and preferred approaches:

```tsx
// Bad
export const demo1 = () => {

}

export const demo2 = () => {

}

// Good
const demo1 = () => {

}
const demo2 = () => {

}

export {
  demo1,
  demo2
}
```

2. Keep type exports separate from value exports, as shown below:

```tsx
export type {
    xxx,
    xxx
}

export {
    xxx,
    xxx
}
```

### Imports

1. Do not add blank lines between imports at the top of a file. The following examples show the incorrect and preferred approaches:

```tsx
// Bad
import { xxx } from "xxx"

import { xxx } from "xxx"

// Good
import { xxx } from "xxx"
import { xxx } from "xxx"
```

### Function Guidelines

1. Prefer arrow functions, such as `() => {}`.
2. Do not prefix function calls with `void`, for example:

```tsx
void helloWorld()
```

3. Do not use generic function names such as `loadData`, `getData`, or `modifySomething`. Name functions according to their business purpose.
4. When more than three `if` branches at the same nesting level compare the same category of state, use a mapping table instead.
5. When an `if` condition combines several business rules, extract the condition into a clearly named predicate function.

```tsx
// Bad
if (
  user.age >= 18 &&
  user.isActive &&
  user.emailVerified &&
  !user.isBanned
) {
  // ...
}

// Good
const canAccess = (user: User) =>
  user.age >= 18 &&
  user.isActive &&
  user.emailVerified &&
  !user.isBanned;

if (canAccess(user)) {
  // ...
}
```

### Styling

1. Use `cn` to merge styles.

```tsx
import { cn } from "cnfast";

cn("px-2 py-1", isActive && "px-4", { "text-red-500": hasError });
// "py-1 px-4 text-red-500"
```

2. Unless necessary, do not hardcode heights or widths. Prefer padding utilities such as `p-xxx` and allow the content to determine the element's size naturally. Hardcoded dimensions can create visual inconsistencies across devices and cause text truncation. Calibrate dimensions so the visual height matches the design, and do not assign arbitrary `p-xxx` values.

### React

1. React Compiler is enabled for this project, so there is no need to use `useMemo`, `useCallback`, or `memo`.

### Splitting Hooks

1. When a hook contains too much state, derived logic, side effects, or branching and becomes difficult to read or maintain, split it into smaller hooks or pure functions.
2. Prefer extracting logic that only performs calculations, transformations, formatting, or conditional checks into standalone functions. Prefer extracting logic closely tied to the React lifecycle or reusable state into smaller hooks.
3. Keep the public API concise after splitting and avoid exposing internal implementation details to callers.

### i18n

1. Do not hardcode any user-visible text. Add all such text to the internationalization translations.

### Constants

1. Move constants into `src/constants` when their definitions exceed 30 lines.
2. Name all constants using uppercase letters separated by underscores.

### Testing

1. Place unit test files in the same directory as the files they test. Do not create a separate `_test_` directory. Place integration and end-to-end tests in the `intergration` and `e2e` directories under `test`.
2. Tests must follow the red-green-refactor development cycle. Do not write tests afterward based on the existing implementation.
3. Do not use TDD or add tests for minor changes, such as styling updates, additional logging, icon replacements, or comment additions. Implement these changes directly.
4. Test code rule `reference/react/test-code-rule.md`

### Comments

1. Every function added or substantially rewritten by AI must include a comment. This requirement includes React components, hooks, utility functions, event handlers, and rendering helpers. Page, application, and routing components that accept no props and have no non-obvious constraints are exempt; do not add comments that merely restate their names or rendered content.
2. Comments must explain why the code is written this way, including the intent, constraints, or tradeoffs behind it. Do not merely translate or restate what the code does.
3. Comments must include a usage example. Use JSX for component examples and TypeScript for hook and utility function examples. A usage example is not required when the function has no parameters.
4. Keep examples concise and show the smallest usable invocation. Avoid lengthy business explanations.
5. Never add emojis to comments.
6. When modifying code, do not remove an existing comment without updating the corresponding code. If code that already has comments is modified, update or supplement those comments as needed.


### Excessive packaging is strictly prohibited

1. Do not extract a function that is called only once and contains no reusable business logic.

```tsx
// Bad
const getUserName = (user: User) => user.name;

const UserCard = ({ user }: Props) => {
  return <span>{getUserName(user)}</span>;
};

// Good
const UserCard = ({ user }: Props) => {
  return <span>{user.name}</span>;
};
```

2. Do not introduce configuration objects or factory functions for a single fixed implementation.
```tsx
// Bad
const createButtonConfig = () => ({
  color: 'primary',
  variant: 'solid',
});

const config = createButtonConfig();

<Button color={config.color} variant={config.variant} />

// Good
<Button color="primary" variant="solid" />
```
3. Do not create custom hooks for trivial logic used by only one component.
```tsx
// Bad
const useDialogVisible = () => {
  const [visible, setVisible] = useState(false);

  return { visible, setVisible };
};

// Good
const [dialogVisible, setDialogVisible] = useState(false);
```

4. Prefer direct, readable code until abstraction clearly reduces duplication or isolates meaningful business logic.

### Standard Component Definitions

1. Alert dialog: `src/components/alert-dialog.tsx`
2. Check box: `src/components/check-box.tsx`
3. Drawer: `src/components/drawer.tsx`
4. Dropdown menu: `src/components/dropdown-menu.tsx`
5. Empty state: `src/components/empty-state.tsx`
6. Loading state: `src/components/loading.tsx`
7. Modal: `src/components/modal-provider.tsx`
8. Popover: `src/components/popover.tsx`
9. Search box: `src/components/search-box.tsx`
10. Select: `src/components/select.tsx`
11. Switch: `src/components/switch.tsx`
